## Tech Stack

1. We will be using Next.js + TailwindCSS as our backbone
2. This site should have also Storyblok, headless CMS integrated as I want to have opportunity to change as many items (photos, texts, links, etc.) as it is possible.
3. Site should also have blog section for the SEO purposes.
4. There also should be a contact section with basic Contact form.

## Sitemap


Home Page (Introduction about me, my experience, the most "eye catchy" part of the website, that should sell me as an consultant or a freelancer)
|
|
Blog --> List of recent 5 blog posts, pagination, tags, share links
|        |
|        Blog post pages with share links, tags, date of publish, and related posts 
|        lists based on the tags for example

|
Contact Page - Simple contact page with Contact form, whatsapp.me button, links to the linkedin and github page

Footer (on every page) --> Copywrights, my legal company details, social links.

## Design

We should use Glassmorhphism and some uptodate design language imperatives. Please note, that this website should be mobile first.

Main colors of my brand are:

- main: #0ddf72
- secondary: #dafce0 
- black: #000000
- white: #ffffff
- dark-green: #1d392b 

We are aiming to create site in the dark mode mood.

## Claude Plugins

I'd like you to use plugins such:

1. context7 to be precise and best practice driven when it comes to next.js, tailwind, and storyblok
2. ui-ux-pro-max as a source of great design ideas
3. frontend-design as a helper
4. playwright to test things


## Questions

If you have any questions, please ask me before you do anything.

## Remarks

Please do this in the loop: Coding (best practices, design) -> tests with playwright -> feedback from me --> improvements --> tests --> etc.
